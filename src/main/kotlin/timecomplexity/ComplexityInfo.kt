package timecomplexity

/**
 *How well does it scale?
 *ans: The term scalability is one of the important terms in domain of technology and computer programming. The term
 * scalability is used with various prefix term like in context of software architecture, database, server etc.
 *
 * For instance: The scalability of database refers, how much client can it handler it easily without facing any sort
 * of problem.
 *
 * In the same way, complexity in terms of algorithm denotes the performance of the algorithm in execution time and
 * memory space consumption when the input size increases. With small amounts of data, even the most expensive
 * algorithm can seem fast due to the speed of modern hardware. However, as data increases, the cost of an expensive
 * algorithm becomes increasingly apparent.bigger, and algo becomes crippling.
 *
 *
 *
 * <==================Time Complexity===================>
 *Time complexity is the measurement of time required to run an algorithm as the input size increases.
 *
 * There are different types of time complexities like constant, linear, quadratic, logarithmic etc which are
 * explained in their individual codes.
